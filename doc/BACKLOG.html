DONE
-----

Add textual comments in the peer assessment

Option to use google domain accounts to avoid account verification and student personal keys.

Add in Settings the reminder relative dates (e.g. 1 day before, 3 days before)

In students Sheet instead of TRUE for each peer assessment save the URL view of response. NOT DONE because it can be saved by the person viewing it. 
THere is no way to have a VIEW only responseform.

Update SUBMITTED field at student

Add reminder email for non-submission

Send email to students who have not confirmed their registration. 
Some of them might have been manually added.

Add deadline. After that peer assessment closes. NO more responses.

Show number of students next to project AND number of peer assessment submitted

Change the deadline and the related triggers after opening the peer assessment

Add settings in the model to remove hard ranges.

Multiple peer assessments for one project

IN Students form there is a SUBMITTED field. 
This refers to current assessment. Move? Add one col for assessment?

Change email messages concerning Peer Assessment to include pa name.

Fill in Settings sheet when created

For peer assessment change false false to Inactive, false true to Open etc.

Close assessment. Send feedback to students. 

Performance: Replace getValue with getValues or DataRange


FIXED
------
Sending reminder to non submission should be reading student pa columns.

DOES NOT find EditURL due to null FormResponse (enames/sheet different timestamps. Get from sheet)

There is an issues with multiple peer assessments and Open. 
The problem is probably related to the form id stored in Projects sheet.
FORM ID should move from Projects to Grades sheet.

Change deadlines does not check if new deadline is in the past

Msg update deadlines should appear only when the assessment 
is inactive (not when open or closed or finished)
