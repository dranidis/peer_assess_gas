    <h2>Adding projects (teams)</h2>
    <p>
        This is the first task to be completed. After deciding the number of teams, add one line per team in the
        <b>Projects</b> sheet. The only necessary data are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> the project's <b>NAME</b> (team's name) and
        <li> a unique <b>KEY</b> for the project. The key should contain no spaces.
    </ul>

    <h2>Settings - Student emails</h2>
    <p>There are two options for students emails. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The best and simplest option is that students use their <em>google domain emails</em> for interacting
            with the PA system. In this case the registration of the student is a one-step process, in which
            students register with their names and project key (see below). To use this option make sure that in the
            <b>Settings</b> sheet
            the <b>domain</b> is set to <b>true</b>. Then use the menu <b>PA -> Install -> Install Registration and
                Verification forms</b> to create
            the forms for student's self registration.</li>
        <li>If using google domain emails is not possible, then set the <b>domain</b> setting to <b>false</b> and then
            use the menu <b>PA -> Install -> Install and Verification forms</b> to create
            the forms for student's self registration. In this case, as explained below the registration is a two-step
            process
            including a verfication step after self-registration.</li>
    </ul>



    <h2>Student registration</h2>
    <h3>Adding students manually</h3>
    <p>
        Students can be manually added in the <b>Students</b> sheet; add one line per student.
        The necessary data are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>First name,
        <li>last name,
        <li>email, and
        <li>project key (matching one of the keys in the <b>Projects</b> sheet).
    </ul>
    <p>
        The rest of the columns are filled by the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you manually add students you have to notify them that they have to verify their accounts. Use the <b>PA ->
            e-mails -> Send reminder to those who did not verify the account</b> menu to let the
        system send the reminder for verification.
    </p>

    <p>
        For google domain emails, you could skip the verification and registration steps altogether. Just
        enter the student data as described above and enter in
        the column <b>VERIFIED</b> the value <b>TRUE</b> for all the students that
        will be using their domain emails.
    </p>

    <h3>Students are added by self-registration</h3>
    <p>
        Get the Registration URL from the menu <b>PA -> Links -> Registration URL</b> by selecting and copying the
        displayed link (Ctrl-C).
        Announce to the students their <b>project key</b> for their project and the <b>Registration URL</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        After students fill in their details they will appear in
        the <b>Students</b> sheet.
    </p>

    <h2>Student account verification (only if not-domain emails have been used)</h2>
    <b>This step is not necessary if domain emails have been used for the registration of students.
        This is determined by the <em>domain</em> flag in settings.
    </b>
    <p>
        All students (either added manually or via self-registration) have to verify their accounts.
        Verified accounts of students have TRUE in <b>VERIFIED</b> column.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use the <b>PA -> e-mails -> Send reminder to those who did not verify the account</b> menu to let the
        system send the reminder for verification to all students that have not verified their accounts yet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Students will receive an email with their personal key and a link to the verification form in order to complete
        their registration to the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>IMPORTANT:</b> Students who don't verify their accounts can not participate in the peer assessment,
        although they will be evaluated by other students.
        This makes sure that their email addresses are correctly entered into the system. Check with students who don't
        verify their account, whether
        their email is correct.
    </p>

    <h2>Projects sheet</h2>
    <p>
        In the projects sheet you can see how many students belong to each group, how many have verified their account
        and how many have filled their
        peer assessment.
    </p>

    <h2>Peer assessments</h2>

    <h3>Entering questions for the peer assessment</h3>
    <p>
        In the <b>Questions</b> sheet enter one row for each question of the peer assessment.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>Some sample questions are provided. Feel free to make any changes.</p>

    <h3>Entering peer assessments</h3>
    <p>

        Two more email reminders will be sent to students. One, 3 days before, and one 1 day before the deadline.
        The intervals of the reminders can be fully customized in the Settings sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
        The form will automatically close at the deadline, and no more responses will be permitted, unless you change
        the deadline.
    </p>

    <h3>Changing the deadline of the peer assessment</h3>
    <p>
        You may change the date of the deadline in the <b>Peer assessments</b> sheet.
        You can do that either before or after the deadline has passed.
    </p>
    <p>
        To complete the change use the menu <b>PA -> Peer assessments -> Update deadlines</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Reminders will be sent again 3 and 1 days before the deadline.
    </p>

    <h3>Grading groups</h3>
    <p>
        In the <b>
            <?= grades ?>
        </b> sheet there is one line per assessment and project pair.
        In this sheet just enter the <b>grade</b> of the group in the specific assessment. The rest of the columns
        are already filled automatically.
        Necessary data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Grade
    </ul>

    <h3>Calculating peer assessment scores</h3>
    <h4>Calculation</h4>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>With the <b>
            <?= pa ?>
        </b> sheet active click on the row of one of the peer assessments.
        Then by using the menu
        <b>PA -> Peer assessments -> Calculate</b> you can have the system
        calculate individual scores.
    </p>
    <p>A new sheet will be created including the [peer assessment id].
        If the sheet already exists it will get cleared before it is filled.
    </p>
    <h4>Peer assessment Settings</h4>
    <p>
        The system uses the WEBPA algorithm for the peer assessment.
        You can change the peer assessment calculation settings in the <b>Settings</b> sheet and perform
        the calculation again. The parameters are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>PA Weight</b>: the percentage of the grade that is adjusted.
        <li><b>PA penalty</b>: the percentage of final mark reduction due to non-submission of peer assessment.
        <li><b>PA self</b>: the peer assessment gather also self-assessment responses. A setting of true takes these
            into account, whereas a setting of
            false ignores the self-assessment responses.
    </ul>

    <h3>Finalizing assessments</h3>
    <p>
        If you wish to announce the results to students select from the menu <b>PA -> Peer assessments -> Finalize</b>.
        A new sheet will be created with the name <b>Final PA</b> and the assessment's key. The sheet contains the
        results to be announced.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finalized assessments should not change.
    </p>

        the PA score and the final grade of the peer assessment. You can set at the <b>Settings</b> sheet
        whether you wish one or both of them not sent.
